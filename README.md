I found an ice maker thrown out in the trash and became fascinated by its working principle. Eager to repair it, I discovered that the original PCB was destroyed due to a burned-out IC, making it irreparable. Instead of giving up, I decided to reverse engineer the ice maker's electronics to recreate a working control board from scratch.
